Software requirements

Splunk Enterprise system requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the [Splunk Enterprise system requirements](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Systemrequirements) apply.

Download
--------

Download |long_name| at |splunkbase_url|.

Installation steps
------------------

NOTE: Where referenced, the |ia_name| and |ta_name| versions of this App are located on Splunkbase.

Deploy to single server instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Deploy as you would any App, and restart Splunk.
1. NOTE: Only the App (or IA for no dashboards) is required. Install only 1 of the G Suite add ons or app.
1. Configure.

Deploy to Splunk Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Have your Splunk Cloud Support handle this installation. Do NOT install the IA on the same system as the App.
1. You may consider using an on-premise Heavy Forwarder to install |ia_name|, and send the logs to Splunk Cloud.

Deploy to a Distributed Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. For each Search Head in the environment, deploy a non-configured copy of the App. DO NOT SEND TA or IA to a Search Head Cluster (SHC).
1. For each indexer in the environment, deploy a copy of the |ta_name| Add-On that is located as mentioned above.
1. For a single "Data Collection Node" OR "Heavy Forwarder" (a full instance of Splunk is required), install |ia_name| and configure through the GUI.
